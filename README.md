# PIC16F877A-Ultrasonic-Radar-with-ESP32-Web-Visualization
An embedded systems project where a PIC16F877A measures distance using an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor and sends data via UART to an ESP32. The ESP32 hosts a Wi-Fi web interface that displays real-time distance data with a live graph, danger-zone color coding, and min/max tracking, alongside local LCD, LED, and buzzer indicators.
